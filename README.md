# ATOS

The goal of the project is to build a Kernel and maybe add some userspace applications.

The kernel should handle :

-time

-synchronization mechanism

-time management

-scheduler

-I/O operations

-multiprocessing

-custom file system

-memory management

Some feature may be added later :

-preemption
-well known filesystem
-Loadable drivers

I am currently targetting x86 platform only.
The whole project is for educational purpose. Feel free to use any part of this work.

The three main sources of knowledge are : 

-wiki.osdev.org

-Linux kernel

-www.osdever.net
