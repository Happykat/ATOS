# ATOS
The goal of the project is to build a Kernel and maybe add some userspace applications.

The kernel should handle :

-time
-synchronization mechanism
-time management
-scheduler
-I/O operations
-multiprocessing
-custom file system
-memory management

Some feature may be added later :

-preemption
-well known filesystem
-Loadable drivers

The whole project is for educational purpose only. Feel free to use any part of this work.

It is mainly inspired from Linux implementation.
The two main sources of knowledge are : osdev.com & Linux kernel

Work should start between 1/08/2015 & 10/08/2015
